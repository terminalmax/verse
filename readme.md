# verse

Verse is a TUI bible viewer written in Rust.


## Usage
Make sure that the database is in the same directory as the executable, then open terminal and type:
> verse
(if verse is not added to path, it must be called from location)

## Limitation
Currently only works with ASV database. Support for other translations should be easy to implement since they have the same schema.

## Database
